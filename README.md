# Das soll mein Blog werden
This blog is inconsistently German and English

Favicon/Logo: https://openclipart.org/detail/349961/brain (everything on the website is licensed under CC0)
jekyll template: https://github.com/jekyll/minima
comment embedding js: https://github.com/dpecos/mastodon-comments/

The script I wrote to automatically post on publication, together with setup instructions, can be found here: https://github.com/jon011235/mastodon-comments-autopost

TODO:
- banner on every page (header with disclaimer about being civil and favorable when reading as well as asking whether people want updates)
- Mail Newsletter?
- get comment_embedding and autoposting through git submodule
- apparently I should change the `Gemfile` to use the github-pages jem and not the jekyll gem
